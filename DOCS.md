# Drone Pushover Plugin

The plugin reads the required parameters from the environment variables and sends a POST request to Pushover.

It's a slightly modified version of the [example go plugin](https://docs.drone.io/plugins/golang/)

The logo was borrowed from [Pushover](https://pushover.net/images/pushover-logo.svg)

The plugin was inspired by [this](https://www.cyberciti.biz/mobile-devices/android/how-to-push-send-message-to-ios-and-android-from-linux-cli/) Cyberciti article.
